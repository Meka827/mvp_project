        It's actually explained by chemistry. When bacon is heated, it undergoes the Maillard Reaction, 
        which causes food to brown and gives it its flavor. With bacon, the reaction causes sugars to react 
        with amino acids, that when combined with bacon fat, creates unique aroma compounds that together 
        make your mouth water.
